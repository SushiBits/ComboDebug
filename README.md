# ComboDebug ARM JTAG Adapter

ComboDebug is a companion adapter for [DAP42][DAP42] debug probe, as well as
standard ARM debuggers with 2.54mm 20-pin interface like [J-Link][JLINK] and
[ST-Link][SLINK].

## Introduction

DAP42 is a CMSIS-DAP compatible USB JTAG debug adapter for ARM Cortex-A and
Cortex-M processors, based on the [STM32F042K6][42K] microcontroller.

This adapter provides a 1.27mm 10-pin modified Cortex Debug Connector with two
of the original ground lines replaced with a serial port.

The serial port can be handled through the DAP42 host interface, or through an
onboard USB to Serial adapter.

It also provides an external target reset button, and an offline programming
trigger button for [DAP42][DAP42]
